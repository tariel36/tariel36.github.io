This video will benefit any level of engineer who wants to start writing code in a TDD way. In this specific video I will be using C# and xUnit but there are similar combinations for testing frameworks across any programming language.<br/>This video is part of my Software Engineering Fundamentals series.<br/>Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.<br/>Feel free to complete steps 6 to 9 and send me the results. | tdd, testing, tutorial | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8TcPr73Bwo) |

This is also known as an IoC container or an inversion of control container. I'm going to do that using C# and .NET Core 3.<br/>In object-oriented design, the dependency inversion principle is a specific form of decoupling software modules. When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details. |  | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSVZa4JuTl8) |

Feature Flags, also known as Feature Toggles, is a technique in software development that attempts to provide an alternative to maintaining multiple source-code branches (known as feature branches), such that a feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. Feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the feature during run time. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for other users. | dotnet, dotnetcore, featureflags | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EebLChouDE) |

| 46 | 2020-01-15 17:00:04 | Resilient HttpClient using Polly and IHttpClientFactory in .NET Core 3 | In this .NET tutorial I will show you how you can create a high performing, efficient and resilient HttpClient using .NET Core's IHttpClientFactory and it's support for Polly.<br/>A new HttpClient instance is returned each time CreateClient is called on the IHttpClientFactory. An HttpMessageHandler is created per named client. The factory manages the lifetimes of the HttpMessageHandler instances.<br/>IHttpClientFactory pools the HttpMessageHandler instances created by the factory to reduce resource consumption. An HttpMessageHandler instance may be reused from the pool when creating a new HttpClient instance if its lifetime hasn't expired.<br/>Pooling of handlers is desirable as each handler typically manages its own underlying HTTP connections. Creating more handlers than necessary can result in connection delays. Some handlers also keep connections open indefinitely, which can prevent the handler from reacting to DNS (Domain Name System) changes. | dotnet, polly, httpclient | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pgvX_Dk0n8) |

Moq is the most popular mocking framework in .NET and even though it is not my personal favourite, I highly recommend it.<br/>In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways, most often as part of a software testing initiative. A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts. | dotnet, tests, mocking | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZvDBSQa_so) |

LINQ is a killer feature for C# and it's one I use extensively personally.

Source generators are a form of metaprogramming that allows us to write code that inspects out code and then write code which is compiled and added in our compiled output. That means that instead of using reflection to resolve services in dependency injection we can write all the code upfront and get safe and performant class resolution. | dotnet, dependencyinjection, sourcegenerators | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqvnqzRNBls) |

IL or Intermediate Language is the language that C#, VB.NET and F# will all compile into and it's what the CLR or Common Language Runtime, will ultimately execute. C# provides a way to emit that IL code and this can be used in multiple things from building dynamic proxies to speeding up reflection. | csharp, dotnet | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H66H8PxcB8) |

It seems that many people, especially newcomers, don't know how enumerables can be extended to support different behavior. In this video I am going to use entity framework as an example  to demonstrate how it looks like LINQ but is actually building and executing a query behind the scenes. This is still very much LINQ but it's not what you might think. | linq, ef, csharp | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2NA1hHT1JE) |

Raw string liretals allows us to deal with string in their raw form without having to format them in a specific way in our code and escape them. It makes working wiht JSON an absolute breeze and I can't wait to use them when C# 11 comes out. | csharp, dotnet, csharp11 | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KXWAgZE8xI) |
| 213 | 2022-04-14 11:30:10 | Is C# getting slower? | In this video I will investigate the claim that new C# features make C# slower.

Before C# 11 C# would actually not optimize statis method group invocation leading to unnecessary memory allocations. The problem was inflated because IDEs such as Visual Studio or Rider would suggest that you use the method group syntax over the long form one, wasting memory. | csharp, dotnet, csharp11 | [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lit18RJYp8) |

The concept of having implementations in interfaces was weird enough in C# 8 and C# 11 introduces static members in them too, but it actually goes beyond that.
